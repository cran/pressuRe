# pressuRe 0.2

* Support for pliance data added 
* Changes to data structure to make analysis more system agnostic
* Masking is now covered by two system agnostic functions, create_mask_manual and create_mask_auto. create_mask_manual wraps create_mask and the custom option in pedar_mask, plus allows the make mask by selecting sensors option available for data from all systems. create_mask_auto wraps automask and pedar_mask1/2/3. These should make workflows much smoother and will let other masking schemes be more easily added in the future
